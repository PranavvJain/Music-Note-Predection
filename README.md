# Music-Note-Predection

# Introduction

In this project we find the optimal machine learning model for generating potentially novel classical music in the style of a given renowned music composer.
The significance of this project is evident in its demonstration of computational and mathematical creativity, which can be leveraged to perform tasks that
have traditionally been performed by humans.
